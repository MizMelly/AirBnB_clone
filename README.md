This is the AirBnB project
Project Description:
AirBnB project is a cornerstone of the ALX Software Engineering School curriculum, challenging students to construct a simplified version of the renowned AirBnB website and deploy it on their servers. 

Project Phases
The project is composed of four (4) different phases to reach completion; of course, every website should have a frontend and a backend component.

1. Command Interpreter: Serving as the foundation, the command interpreter allows for data manipulation without a graphical interface, akin to a Shell environment. This phase is pivotal, providing developers with a platform for iterative development and debugging.
2. Website (Frontend): The face of the final product, the website showcases static and dynamic content to users, offering an experience tailored to their needs.
3. Data Storage: Whether through databases or files, this phase ensures the seamless storage and retrieval of crucial data objects, facilitating efficient information management.
4. API Development: Acting as the bridge between the frontend and data storage, the API enables communication and interaction, empowering users to retrieve, create, delete, and update data seamlessly.

How to start it
 start by organizing our code in a structured manner. We’ll create a folder named “models” to store all the classes and models related to our storage functionality.

First, we’ll navigate to our project directory and create a new folder called “models”. This folder will serve as a container for all our model classes.
"mkdir models"
Inside the “models” folder, we’ll create two files: __init__.py and base_model.py. The __init__.py file signals to Python that the folder is a package, while the base_model.py file will contain our BaseModel class.
"cd models"
"touch __init__.py base_model.py"
